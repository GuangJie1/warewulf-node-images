# Example container definitions

The container definitions in the `examples/` directory aren't pre-built as
containers published by Warewulf.

Typical reasons may include:

* The resultant container would be too large.
* The definition is too specific to be broadly useful, and covering a wide
  enough set of versions would be impractical.
* The definition uses software that may not be redistributed.
